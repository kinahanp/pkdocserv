Introduction and aims</p><p>This paper reviews previous research into the soils of the largest ter-  restrial volcano on the European mainland, the  active  Mt Etna (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Fig. 1</span>), and analyses new  data. Because  of their global distribution, the human settlements and  economies they  support, their distinctive properties and signi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cance as an element of the  volcanic environment, volcanic soils have  attracted much attention from specialists in pedology, ecolo-  gy, hydrology, environmental chemistry, horticulture and  archaeology. Soils may also contribute to the impact of volcanoes on the atmosphere: rapid weathering of volcanic materials, a part of pedogenesis, may con-  stitute an important sink in the global CO<span class="s16">2  </span>cycle (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Vitousek et al., 1997</span>). Distinguishing between release of soil-derived CO<span class="s16">2   </span>and  the  higher degassing rates of magma-derived CO<span class="s16">2 </span>is an important aid in predicting volcanic activity (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Liuzzo et al., 2013</span>).

Speci<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>c process pathways, development rates and  geography of soils on a par-  ticular  volcano, however,  are  not   readily predicted.  Large,  active volcanoes, especially those of predominantly Hawaiian/Strombolian eruptive style such  as Mt Etna, present some of the most complex soil- forming environments on Earth.  Historic activity on Mt Etna has been predominantly  Strombolian in  style,   but   periodic phases  of  lava fountaining of Hawaiian style  generate considerable lapilli fall on the  <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>anks. In the historic period there have been major explosive eruptions including the  plinian event of 122 BC which deposited up to 15 cm of tephra on  Catania  some 30 km  from  the  vent (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Coltelli et  al., 1998</span>). Several subplinian eruptions have  also occurred (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Branca and  Del Carlo,</span><br/><span style=" color: #2E3092;">2005</span>). Diversity in age and character of volcanic materials, land surface morphology, local climate, vegetation and  land  use history translates into complex soil spatial patterns determined by controls operating at scales  of differing spatial order, e.g. local climate, age and  morphology of lava <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow, and even  individual plants (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Certini et al., 2001</span>). In the ver-  tical  dimension (i.e. pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le), complex soils  result from  intermittent tephra deposition, anthropogenic disturbance, erosion and  subsequent deposition. Soil pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>les may re<span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ect the amount and frequency of tephra deposition as much as <span class="s14">‘</span>normal<span class="s14">’ </span>pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le-forming soil processes operating<br/><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2015.09.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2015.09.023</a></p><p class="s11">0341-8162/© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The building-up of soil by the addition of tephra may  have  either a <span class="s14">‘</span>retardant<span class="s14">’ </span>or  <span class="s14">‘</span>developmental<span class="s14">’  </span>effect on  pedogenesis (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Johnson, 1985</span>). In the  former case existing soil is effectively sealed by burial,  and  pedogenesis begins anew in fresh  material; in the  latter,<br/>pedogenesis keeps pace  with a lesser amount of added tephra, absorb- ing the  new  material, the soil nevertheless being  altered and  made more dif<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cult to interpret. A problem in dealing with the  impact of tephra deposition is its  considerable spatial variation,  because the</p><p class="s11">P. James  et al. / Catena 137  (2016) 277<span class="s17">–</span>297</p><p class="s11">279</p><p>history of deposition at a particular location is unlikely to be known. Furthermore, units of tephra in soil are not everywhere easily differen- tiated in the  <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>eld.<br/>Many analyses of soil spatial variation on volcanoes relate soil prop- erties to environmental gradients which represent important state fac- tors in pedogenesis. The gradients are sequences of age, climate (as it varies  with elevation and slope  orientation), vegetation or topography. Many volcanic environments are well suited to chronosequence studies because of the  age-range of lava surfaces. Examples abound. <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Vitousek et al. (1997) </span>applied the chronosequence approach to the study of soil and  ecosystem development across  a well-de<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ned 1.4 m yr sequence in Hawaii.  Shorter age-ranges have  been examined in Italy: e.g. on Mt Amiata by <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Lulli (2007)</span>, and  in three studies comprising the most com-  prehensive published analyses of soil pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>les on Mt Etna to date,  by <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Egli et al. (2007, 2008, 2012)</span>. Drawbacks of soil chronosequence model- ling include the  role of factors other than time and  the  problem of cli- mate change over longer timescales (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Huggett, 1998</span>). There  is also the  problem of determining age of landforms and/or sediments. Age esti-  mates for older (<span class="s14">N </span>3000  ka) lava  <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows on  Mt Etna  are  only  broadly constrained (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">De Beni et al., 2011</span>). Where appropriate and  with careful interpretation, however, chronosequence studies provide at least  a good  basis  to begin  analysis of processes and  patterns of soil develop- ment across  an area.<br/>Pedological research on Mt Etna has tended to concentrate either on selected soil properties or processes, or on relationships between soils and  certain vegetation types or plant species, and  deals  in most cases with comprehensive analyses of a small number of soil pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>les. This approach is essential to understanding the soils and  the envi-  ronmental controls upon them. Of equal importance, however, are  the  soils&#39; spatial relationships with environmental controls as they  vary  across  the  volcano. There  are  two small-scale soil maps of Mt Etna (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Comitato per  la Carta  dei  Suoli, 1966; Fierotti et al., 1988</span>), but  without accompanying published details on the soils. <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Egli et al. (2007, 2008, 2012) </span><span class="s14">ﬁ</span>nd  that a number of soil properties are related to age of the substrate lava and to elevation (and therefore precipita- tion, temperature and  vegetation). In the present study we cast the  spatial net  more widely, examining a sample of soils on all <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>anks of the volcano, and across  a range of environments, including those dis-  turbed by agriculture, and across a range of local climates. The soil at-  tributes selected for analysis are fundamental to soils generally and  to volcanic soils particularly. Our aim is to determine whether, and  to what extent, environmental controls on pedogenesis and soil spa-  tial distribution are  identi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>able from  the  complex of in<span class="s14">ﬂ</span>uences af- fecting the soils  sampled. This is attempted using  statistical tests and  by considering spatial variation in soil characteristics. Soil vari-  ables  are <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>rst plotted against age of lava <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow.  The <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows comprise a chronosequence. The soils in a strict sense do not: they have  devel- oped through a range of past  environmental conditions. Age of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow  is, nevertheless, a sound basis  for soil sampling, and  the question of the  extent to which soil properties re<span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ect <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow-age remains one  to be addressed.<br/>Soils are  described using  the  terminology of <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Schoeneberger et al. (2012)</span>. They are  classi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ed only tentatively, and  as far as the  derived data permit, according to the  Soil Taxonomy system (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Soil Survey  Staff,</span><br/><span style=" color: #2E3092;">1999</span>).

Mt Etna</p><p>Volcanism in the  Etnean region started during the  middle Pleisto- cene,  at about 600  ka (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Branca et  al., 2004</span>). The volcano now  spans<br/>3350  m in elevation and  40 km in basal  diameter; tephra fall has been frequent. Below 1100  m above  sea level (a.s.l.), the  sampling zone  (i.e.<br/>120<span class="s14">–</span>1030 m),  lava  varies  in  age  from  the  2014/15 <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow  to  the  ca<br/>500,000 yr-old tholeitic basalts of a small  area  on the  lower part of the southern <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Gillot et al., 1994; De Beni et al., 2011</span>). Flows of the  last millennium (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Fig. 1</span>a),  referred to below as <span class="s14">‘</span>historical<span class="s14">’</span>, are  dated using  written records; older  (<span class="s14">‘</span>prehistoric<span class="s14">’</span>) <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows by archaeomagnetic and radiometric, particularly U series,  dating (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Condomines et al., 1982; Tanguy  et al., 2007, 2012</span>). Terrain of historical and of some prehistoric <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows  is  dominated by  rugged  aa  lava,  pahoehoe and   toothpaste morphology<span class="s20">1  </span>(<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Kilburn  and  Guest,  1993; Polacci  and  Papale,  1999; Guest et al., 2012</span>). The mineralogy and  geochemistry of historical and  young prehistoric Mt Etna lavas vary little  (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Romano and  Guest, 1979</span>: see  <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Table  1</span>;  <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Tanguy  et  al., 1997; Corsaro  and  Pompilio, 2004</span>). The hawaiite lavas are porphyritic with up to 45% phenocrysts comprising plagioglase, clinopyroxene and  olivine  (typically in that order of abun- dance)  set  in   a  matrix  of  microlites  and   glass   with  scattered titanomagnetite granules (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Chester et al., 1985</span>). Explosive activity from  summit craters is frequent. Less frequent eruptions, often  with higher effusion rates,  occur from  <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank vents, with Strombolian activity from  vents high  on the  volcano (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Chester et al., 1985</span>). The geochemistry of the tephra, emitted from summit craters and  lateral vents, is similar to<br/>that of the lava (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Coltelli et al., 2000</span>). The tephra (which consists of phe- nocrysts set in a glassy matrix) varies  in deposition rate  and  particle- size with distance and direction from source, and accumulates unevenly on rugged lava surfaces. The detailed tephra chronostratigraphy at any location is thus likely to be unique and  unknown. <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Heiken and  Wohletz (1985) </span>reported the  median particle-size of tephra samples from  a<br/>1971 eruption to vary between .001 and 1 mm. There are few tephra de-  posits comprising extensive  stratigraphic  markers  (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Del Carlo  and Branca, 1998</span>). In the  soils we examine, only one buried tephra layer  is identi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ed, that of the  1669  eruption of the  Monti  Rossi cinder cones  (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Fig. 1</span>b).

At the  sites  examined, the  Etna broom occurs  on <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows older than that of 1923; 3 m-high deciduous oak (Quercus sp.) on the  1865  <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow; 3.5 m evergreen oak (Q. ilex) on the  1792  <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow; mature deciduous oak woodland on the 1408, and mixed deciduous woodland on prehistor- ic <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows. Agricultural terraces or walled enclosures occur at <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ve of the sites (<span class="s14">≥ </span>671 yr-old), and intense grazing at two (Supplementary Table 1).<br/>Using  palynological data  from  Lago  di  Pergusa in  central Sicily (667 m a.s.l., 70 km to the west of Mt Etna),  <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Sadori  and  Narcisi (2001) </span>infer that the  transition from  dry Pleistocene to more moist Holocene climate started at about 10,700 yr BP. The wettest conditions of the Post-  glacial occurred between ~ 9000<span class="s14">–</span>~ 7200  yr BP, followed by a trend to-  wards desiccation at about 3000  yr BP. Signi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cant human impact upon vegetation and  soils of Mt Etna  is likely  to have  begun early,  during the  Bronze  Age, if not  in  Neolithic times (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Leighton,  1999; Chester et al., 2010</span>).<br/>In a few of the  many papers published on the  chemistry of gas and  particle emissions, rainwater and groundwater, implications are consid- ered for rock weathering but not for pedogenesis. Degassing from  the  summit craters continuously releases volatiles into  the  atmosphere, with high enrichment of at least  13 trace metals together with Al, Fe, CO<span class="s16">2  </span>and  SO<span class="s16">2  </span>in the  volcanic plume (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Buat-Ménard and  Arnold,  1978; Varekamp et al., 1986; Francis  et al., 1998; Gauthier and  le Cloarec,</span><br/><span style=" color: #2E3092;">1998; Varrica et al., 2000; Aiuppa  et al., 2003a,  2003b</span>). Mt Etna is the  world&#39;s greatest point source of F, SO<span class="s16">2  </span>and  HCl (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Allard, 1997; Francis  et al., 1998</span>), <span class="s14">b </span>1% being  deposited around the volcano during eruptions (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Aiuppa et al., 2006</span>). Rapid downward mixing of the  plume on to the  lower <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>anks of the volcano, however, occurs under certain meteorolog- ical conditions (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Allen et al., 2006</span>). Particulate emissions also contribute signi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cantly to  rainwater  chemistry  (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Cimino and  Toscano,  1998</span>), deposition rates of major ions  being  controlled mainly by  rainfall (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Aiuppa et al., 2006</span>). Na, K, Ca and  Mg have  varied sources, including volcanic ash and aerosols. Volcanic emissions comprise a signi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cant ad-  dition to dust sources of many chemical elements in lichens on Mt Etna (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Varrica et al., 2000</span>). <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Vacca et al (2003) </span>and <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Egli et al.

In the  scheme of <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Soil Survey Staff (1975) </span>a separate Andisol Order had not been intro- duced (they were in 1978); the  soils classed by Fierotti et al. as <span class="s14">‘</span>andic<span class="s14">’  </span>would probably  include soils  now   classed as  Andisols.

The former authors de-  scribe  different characteristics between soil under the canopy of broom and that outside the canopy on Monti Rossi. The sand  fraction of these soils is largely  vesiculated glass, with plagioclase, augite, magnetite and  apatite.

Contrasts between soil pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>les on Mt Vetore (1800 m  a.s.l.) and  Monti  Rossi  (850 m  a.s.l.)  are  attributed by <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Fernández-Sanjurjo et al.

(2008) </span>compared the  structural and  functional properties of the microbial communities in two soils of different ages  on Mt Etna. The microbial community in the older  soil was  structurally more diverse than that of the younger soil but  proved in experiments not  to be more resistant to environmental disturbance simulated by experimental heating.<br/>The important role of reactive surfaces of <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ne  materials of Mt Etna soils on the storage and release of volcanigenic pollutants to groundwa- ter has been demonstrated. <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Bellomo et al.

(2008) </span>examined eight soils (6 on the N, 2 on the SE <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank) between 780 and 1090 m a.s.l., on lavas 125 to 115,000 yr old and with estimated mean annual rainfalls ranging between 1100  and  1200  mm. Only soils on non-agricultural land  were sampled. The soils, classi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ed using <span style=" color: #2E3092;">IUSS Working Group  WRB (2006)</span>, were equivalent to Entisol  on the 125-yr old lava, Inceptisols on 358 and 438 yr BP lavas and Andisols  on 115,000 yr BP lavas. The main mineral transformations were inferred to be volcanic glass <span class="s14">→ </span>imogolite-type minerals <span class="s14">→ </span>kaolinite. Textures were predominantly sand  and  loamy  sand.  These  authors found the  chief pedogenic processes to be leaching of base cations and passive en-  richment of Al and  Fe, and  that these were pronounced in the  early  stages of pedogenesis, with much reduced rate  of change between<br/>15,000 and  115,000 yrs. In contrast, the  rate of formation of imogolite- type  minerals and  particularly of ferrihydrite was more linear through the chronosequence. Imogolite was transformed to kaolinite, amounts of 2:1-type clay minerals being  very  small  even  on the oldest <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows, and inferred to have  been released from  glass  by weathering rather than resulting from  pedogenic transformation. The scarcity of the  2:1 type  clay minerals was  attributed to addition of ash and  low rainfall.  The accumulation rate  of soil organic matter was  most rapid in <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows up to 2000 yr old, tending to zero after 15,000 yr. Stabilisation of organic matter was related to pyrophosphate-extractable Al and  Fe phases, ka- olinite and   clay  content,  rather than to  imogolite-type  material. <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Baglieri et al. (2010) </span><span class="s14">ﬁ</span>nd, however, that glycerol-extractable soil organ- ic  fractions  were  closely bound  to  SROMS, particularly  in  older (<span class="s14">N </span>9000 yr) soils (Udivitrands), and consequently less subject to biodeg- radation.

(2007) </span>conclude that organic C stocks,  (and imogolite-type minerals and  crys-  talline Fe-oxyhydroxides) decreased with elevation.<br/>In a study of their elevation sequence of soils, <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Egli et al. (2012) </span>ad-  dress the complex and  important issue  of <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>re impacts on the soils. The stable   soil   organic  fraction  at   higher  elevations  survived  from  <span class="s14">N </span>8000  yr, dating close to the  onset of pedogenesis, whereas with de-  creasing elevation soil charcoal analysis indicates a history of increased <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>re  frequency causing vegetation change and  rejuvenation of soil or- ganic  matter. The authors conclude, however, that <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>re  frequency on Mt Etna is not such  as to deplete a large  pool of soil organic matter. In a subsequent study of this  elevation sequence, <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Mastrolonardo et al. (2013) </span>illustrate the  importance of <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>re  on the  quality and  quantity of soil organic matter on Mt Etna. Fire frequency is inferred to be a factor  in stocks  of organic C and  N and  of C resistant to chemical oxidation (all increasing with decreasing elevation). These  authors stress the  major importance of vegetation and local climate as factors in amounts and  nature of the organic matter in the soils they analyse.<br/><span style=" color: #2E3092;">Bellanca et al. (1996) </span>account for differences between A and B hori- zons in one soil to an age-difference of tephra between the horizons.

Superimposed buried soils (classi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ed as Typic Hapludands) in  two  deep exposures of  radiocarbon-dated tephra sequences are described by <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Agnelli et al.

(E  <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank),  are   now   under  chestnut (Castanea sativa) and pine  forest (Pinus laricio), respectively. The base  of the oldest sequence sampled dates from ~ 7000  yr BP, the timescales for  development of  the  buried soils  being  much shorter than this, <span class="s14">b </span>800 yr in one case. Neoformed <span class="s14">‘</span>amorphous<span class="s14">’ </span>and crystalline mineralog- ical phases were absent, a feature attributed to insuf<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ciently intense, or too short a period, of pedogenesis.</p><p class="s14">4. Materials and methods</p><p>Soils were sampled at 23 sites in 1999.

The  soils  examined  occur   in  tephra  (of varying particle-sizes) deposited on lava and accumulating particularly in cracks  and depressions, though in two soils alluvial deposition of local soil ma-  terial was evident. Below, soils are referred to by site number with age of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow  in brackets. The ages  of lava <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows (Supplementary Table 1) are based on the  Geological Map of Etna Volcano (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Branca et al., 2011</span>). The dating of lavas older  than reliable historic records (<span class="s14">N</span>~ 400 yr BP) is tentative and  where possible based on archaeomagnetic and  radio- metric dating (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Tanguy et al., 2012</span>), though dates for some older  <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows are constrained only by stratigraphical relationships.

For those lavas constrained only by a range of age (in some cases, very broad), a date at the  mid-point of the range is used  (Supplementary Table 1). Archaeological evidence (Drs. Gianna  Ayala  and  Francesco  Privitera,  pers.  comm.) was  used  in  the  <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>eld  where possible. Where surface and margins of older <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows are concealed by well developed plant cover and where agricultural use is intensive it may be dif<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cult to identify <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows in the <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>eld,  or to know the age of the  underlying lava. ES23 posed a particular problem, this  being  a dagala<span class="s20">2 </span>of unknown age (Supplementary Table 1). Samples from  this  site are  therefore excluded from  all statistical analyses which involve the  age of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow.<br/>Annual  rainfall for study sites (Supplementary Table 1) is estimated by interpolation from  data  quoted by <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Durbin and  Henderson-Sellers (1981) </span>(<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Fig. 1</span>b). Sites and  soils were described in the  <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>eld,  following <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Schoeneberger et al. (2012)</span>. Where feasible,  soil pits were dug to bed-  rock or to clast-supported lava blocks (horizons denoted by <span class="s14">‘</span>R<span class="s14">’ </span>in Sup-  plementary Table 1). As tephra strati<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cation was impossible to de<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ne in most cases  (c.f. <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Buurman et al., 2004</span>), the  horizon notation used  in Supplementary Table 1 gives the  pedological character of each  horizon but does  not de<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ne sequences of buried layers,  which inevitably occur  (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Agnelli et al., 2007</span>). As we do not have  all data  required for full classi-  <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cation following Soil Taxonomy (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Soil Survey  Staff, 1999</span>), we name soils tentatively at the  Order  or Suborder level only. The three criteria for Andisol  classi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cation not determined are P adsorption, bulk density and  volume proportion of volcanic glass (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Soil Survey  Staff, 1999</span>). The high  glass content observed in many relatively young soils on Mt Etna (which we  classify  as Entisols) will reduce the  threshold amounts of SROMs required to qualify  a soil as Andisol (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Soil Survey  Staff, 2014</span>), but on this  criterion alone,  ES1(1928 AD); ES2(1928 AD); ES3(1928 AD); ES9(1809 AD); ES12(1651 AD) and ES22(1843 AD) would fail to qualify  as Andisols  (year of emplacement of lava <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow  in parentheses after  site number).<br/>Prior to laboratory analysis, samples were air-dried, disaggregated  and passed through a 2 mm sieve. Sub-samples for particle-size analysis were not dried further in order to avoid irreversible aggregation on dry-  ing where amorphous materials are present (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Nanzyo et al., 1993</span>).

The conventional procedures were used  for  extraction  of:  1.  organic-bound (by pyrophosphate),  denoted below as e.g. Fe<span class="s16">p</span>; 2. inorganic non-crystalline (by NH<span class="s16">4 </span>oxalate), denoted as e.g. Fe<span class="s16">o-p</span>, and 3. crystalline phases of Fe and Al (by dithionite), denot- ed as e.g. Fe<span class="s16">d-o</span>. These data are to be treated with caution as, for example, oxalate may dissolve a portion of the  crystalline phase (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">García-Rodeja et al., 2007; Agnelli et al., 2007; Algoe et al., 2012</span>).<br/>In the following sections, after discussion of pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le morphology, the analytical variables are examined in relation to age of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow  and location in terms of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank of the volcano, the latter varying signi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cantly in rainfall amount and  tephra fallout from  summit eruptions. For brevity, the  moister <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>anks of the  volcano (i.e. NE, E, SE and  S) are referred to as E <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank,  other sectors as W <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank.  Spearman correlation (<span class="s14">ρ </span>= coef<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cient; p = probability of null hypothesis) and  the  Mann<span class="s14">–</span>Whitney U test are  used. For parametric statistical analyses non-normal variables are trans- formed using log<span class="s16">10</span>, square root, and in one case (Fe<span class="s16">d-o</span>) an inverse trans- formation.  Of the  functions tested  for  regression models relating transformed soil variables to age of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow  (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Figs. 2 and 10</span>a)  the quadratic proved ef<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cient in terms of signi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cance level in the  great majority of cases.  Multivariate analyses used  are  principal components analysis (pca) and cluster analysis. In the former, orthogonal components are ro- tated using  Varimax.  The unsupervised, agglomerative, hierarchical cluster analysis using  the  <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>rst four components of the  pca is based on the  Euclidean distance as the dissimilarity measure and  Ward&#39;s group- ing method, with all variables standardized to mean of zero  and  vari-  ance of 1.</p><p class="s14">5.

Pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le morphology<br/>Details  of pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le morphology and  site conditions are given  in Sup-  plementary Table 1. <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Table 3 </span>groups soils according to extent of develop- ment expressed in pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le morphology. On this criterion, there is a clear  trend of increasing pedogenesis with age of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow  between the groups, I to IV (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Table 3</span>). Only in the  two  soils of group IV, ES6 (15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka) and  ES13 (450 AD), was  there a clear  B horizon and  a colour other than black  (with  colour  value   <span class="s14">≥ </span>3).  Very  shallow  soils,  Psamments  (I, <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Table 3</span>), occur  in rock-dominant areas of (mostly young) lava <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows with very thin (commonly <span class="s14">b </span>5 cm)  accumulations of tephra and  other<br/>allochthonous mineral and  organic material in depressions in bedrock surfaces or between blocks  in aa lava. Vegetation is limited to lichens or mosses, or may also include a narrow range of vascular plants. Exam-  ples are ES1, ES2 and ES3 on the 1928 Mascali <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow. Organic matter con-  tent  may  be  relatively high  under a  more developed plant cover  (Supplementary Table 1). The soils are black (2.5Y 2.5/1), sandy, cindery or ashy, vitric, and occur in pockets (typically <span class="s14">b </span>30 cm in diameter) in ex- posed lava where organic debris and  small  amounts of tephra collect.  Commonly, ash  and  lapilli  are  trapped within the  plant cover.  On aa <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows, mosses bridge narrow interstices between the lava  clinker.  Smooth,  little  weathered surfaces of pahoehoe lava  on  a 1991  <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow  collect mineral and  plant detritus, moisture and  rabbit dung in depres- sions,  and  support a number of plant species and  larvae.  The lava sur-  faces beneath these soils had  no sign of weathering visible  in the <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>eld.  <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Vingiani  et al. (2013) </span>report that mineral fragments which have  been transported to accumulate in cavities and  depressions on young lava <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows of Mt Etna are little altered chemically beneath a cover of lichens.<br/>Developed in thicker tephra than those soils described above,  are coarse-textured Entisols  (or  Andisols) with limited visible  evidence of pedogenesis (II  in  <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Table  3</span>).  Suf<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cient amounts  of  glass,  value   of (Al<span class="s16">o </span>+ ½Fe<span class="s16">o</span>)% and  horizon thickness (<span class="s14">≥ </span>18 cm) would qualify  some of these soils as Vitrandic Xeropsamments or Vitrandic Ustipsamments (depending on moisture regime). Tephra is of highly  variable thickness (7 cm to <span class="s14">N </span>120 cm), depending in part on the underlying lava morphol- ogy. With the exception of reddish brown Monti Rossi (Red Mountains) tephra in ES20 (1329 AD) the soils are black (predominantly 2.5Y 2.5/1  and 10YR 2/1),  ashy, cindery or pumiceous, sandy, occasionally skeletal, loose,  stony or very stony,  non-sticky and  non-plastic. Such soils are very  common in the  study area  on <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows of all morphologies, dating from  1923  AD to 1329  AD in the  cases  we sampled. They have  O, A or Ap horizons between 3 and  15 cm thick  over  little  altered ash, lapilli, cinder, clinker, pumice or scoria. The soils vary in texture, horizon thick- ness and depth to lithic contact. Otherwise, variation in pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le morphol- ogy is limited to very  weak,  barely perceptible structure in some A horizons. Organisms observed in these soils in February were larvae,  millipedes and ants. Roots commonly extend to bedrock. Vegetation in- cludes herbs and grasses, often with mosses and, in some cases, lichens. Broom is common (to 4 m in height); deciduous oaks are 3 m high near ES14 (1865 AD), 8 m  near ES15 (1689 AD) and  mature near ES21 (1408 AD); evergreen oak grows to 6 m at ES12 (1651 AD) and  ES20 (1329 AD). Land has  been organized for terraced agriculture only  at ES20 (1329 AD). Here, dark  reddish-brown (2.5YR 3/4) cinder from the<br/>1669  Monti  Rossi <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank eruption at the base  of the  soil appears to have  been used to level the lava surface for terrace construction. There was ev- idence of grazing by sheep at ES9 (1809 AD) and by rabbits at other sites.<br/>Other  soils developed in tephra and lacking  a B horizon are Entisols or  Andisols  (III  in  <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Table  3</span>) of <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ner texture than in groups I and  II,</p><p class="s11"><span class="s17">Fig. 2</span>.

The <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ner texture of these soils results from  either a <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ner parent tephra (ES4 15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka) or from more advanced weathering than in those soils described above.  In the  silty clay loam of ES17 and ES18 (both in the range, 42 to 28 ka), no material coarser than sand-size was  observed. Related to the  <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ner texture is a weak granular or blocky structure in A horizons of some soils and  the  presence of earthworms (Supplementary Table 1), which, where more common, cause  marked bioturbation: in ES17, earthworm burrows, ex- tending to the base of the soil, are a striking feature. Consistence varies  from non- to moderately sticky, but slightly friable  in ES8 (15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka). All sites have a mixed herb and grass <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ora; a number have been terraced for agriculture, recent cultivation having been abandoned in several cases.  Trees are deciduous oak:  3 m high  at ES7 (1180 ± 30 AD) and<br/>6 m at ES8 (15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka);  olives  (Olea europaea) at ES10 (15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka)<br/>and  olives and  prickly  pear  (Opuntia <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cus-indica) in a walled enclosure at ES4 (15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka). In all cases where lava surfaces were examined be- neath soils they  were <span class="s14">‘</span>clean<span class="s14">’</span>,  irrespective of age of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow.  Red tephra of the Monti  Rossi 1669  eruption occurred in ES24 (1000 ± 50 AD) (Sup- plementary Table 1).<br/>The most fully developed soils examined have  a Bw horizon (IV, <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Table 3</span>). These are either Inceptisols or Andisols,  are very dark  greyish brown (10YR 3/2) to brown (10YR 4/3),  silt loam  over clay loam  (ES6<br/>15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka) and  loam  (ES13 1651  AD).

A horizons are blocky;  the  Bw in ES13 being  blocky  and  in ES6, prismatic. ES6 is distinct in most respects from  other soils examined. Unusually for Etnean soils, the  lower part of the  pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le is not  free- draining, slight  gleying  occurring on the  ped  faces of the  lower part of the  Bw horizon. The soil, at least  in part,  appears to have  been washed into the  depression where the  soil occurs,  which may account for the  presence of pottery fragments at a 33<span class="s14">–</span>34 cm depth. ES6 and  ES13 are  in enclosed <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>elds and  are the most intensively farmed soils examined, ES6 being  grazed by cattle and  ES13 cultivated.

There  are, however, variations on each  <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank with,  for example, anomalously low values which are dif<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cult to explain in ES17 and  ES18 (42<span class="s14">–</span>28 ka) (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Fig. 2</span>c), samples ES17/1 to 3 yielding the  only values <span class="s14">b </span>5.0.<br/>5.2.4. Bases<br/>In common with <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ndings of <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Egli et al. (2008)</span>, Na is the most respon- sive of the bases  to weathering and leaching. In the present study, of all those measured, this  property shows one of the  most marked changes with age of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow  (correlation: <span class="s14">ρ − </span>.850, p <span class="s14">b </span>.001), the rate  of loss show- ing no sign of abating over the  ~ 35,000-yr range (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Fig. 2</span>d).

This contrasts with the  <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ndings of <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Egli et al. (2008)</span>, that base  cation leaching is a dominant process in their sample of Mt Etna soils, and  of <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Martínez Cortizas  et al. (2007)</span>, who  report a reduction in K and  Ca (as  well as in Na), with an increasing degree of weathering in a wide  range of  European   volcanic  soils.   Such   element   depletion   <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Martínez Cortizas et al. (2003) </span>attribute to the diluting effect of organic matter on  element  concentration, and  the mobility of certain elements. Nevertheless, they <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>nd  that, despite signi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cant depletion of Ca and  K in soils of the Gauro  (Campi Flegrei) and  Vico volcanoes, Ca en-  hancement occurs in organic-rich horizons, which they attribute to biocycling of the element. In most soils we analyse, Ca and  more es- pecially K show an up-pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le increase (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3), these cations correlating negatively with depth in the soil (Ca: <span class="s14">ρ −</span><br/>.364, p .001; K: <span class="s14">ρ −</span>.312, p .004). Ca correlates positively with organic C (<span class="s14">ρ </span>.396, p <span class="s14">b </span>.001). Quality of organic matter (and therefore possibly its age)  appears, however, to have  greater control on base  distribu- tion  than organic C concentration: K correlates negatively with the  C/N  ratio.  Ca, Mg and  Na (in contrast to its  negative correlation with organic C) correlate positively with C/N (correlation details not shown). A factor  in greater near-surface Ca, Mg and  Na concen- trations in a number of soils we  sample may  be soil-rejuvenation<br/>by tephra. A signi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cant distinction of Mt Etna  among most of its<br/>European volcanic peers is that it is continually active.<br/>Na, Mg, Ca and  K all correlate with rainfall (K negatively: <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Table 4a</span>), and  all show signi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cant differences between the  E and  W <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>anks, the  <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>rst three tending to occur  in greater amount on the  E <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Table 4b</span>). The E<span class="s14">–</span>W contrast may re<span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ect greater tephra fall on the E <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank. This, how- ever, would not appear to be a major factor  in K distribution.<br/>5.2.5.

The stronger correlations with age of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow,  however, are for the crystalline (Fe<span class="s16">d-o</span>: <span class="s14">ρ </span>.719, p <span class="s14">b </span>.001) and organic-complexed (Fe<span class="s16">p</span>: <span class="s14">ρ </span>.711, p <span class="s14">b </span>.001)  phases, both showing a steepening increase on <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows of <span class="s14">N </span>200 yr (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Fig. 2</span>h<span class="s14">–</span>j).

Lack of correlation between each of these phases and organic C is not consis- tent with the protection of organic matter by SROMS, commonly in- ferred for  volcanic soils,  though degree of humi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cation may  be  a factor: Al<span class="s16">o-p  </span>correlates negatively with C/N (<span class="s14">ρ −</span>.315, p .004).

The component does not correlate with age, but positively with rainfall (<span class="s14">ρ </span>.523, p <span class="s14">b </span>.001: <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Table 4a</span>), and there are signi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cantly greater scores on the E <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Table 4b</span>), consistent with conditions favouring persistence of a high Fe<span class="s16">o-p</span>/Fe<span class="s16">d-o </span>ratio. The less organic-rich soil at depth may explain a predominant down-pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le decrease in scores (not shown), occurring in all soils except ES6 (15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka), ES12 (1651 AD), and ES22 (1843 AD). A feature of pc3 scores not shared by pc1 or pc2 is a reduction in rate  of decrease down-pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le, or a reversal in trend, in the lowest parts of the  sampled pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>les at  twelve locations,  ES4 (15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka); ES5 (950 ±<br/>50  AD); ES6 (15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka);  ES8 (15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka);  ES9 (1809  AD); ES12<br/>(1651 AD); ES14 (1865 AD); ES19 (1792 AD); ES20 (1329 AD); ES21 (1408 AD); ES23 (age unknown) and  ES24 (1000 ± 50 AD), though scores remain negative.<br/>pc4, a <span class="s14">‘</span>relatively high C/N<span class="s14">–</span>organic C<span class="s14">–</span>base cation<span class="s14">’ </span>component, is the<br/>only component with positive loadings for all four bases, Ca, Mg, Na and  K. These are not associated in this component with signals of much ad- vanced pedogenesis in terms of particle-size, Fe<span class="s16">o-p</span>/Fe<span class="s16">d-o </span>and  C/N ratio.  Across  the  matrix,  loadings differ  between the  bases,  presumably re<span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ecting the interplay between parent material, loss from the soil dur- ing pedogenesis and retention by plants, the most salient features being  the marked loss of Na and a putative retention of at least K by plants. pc4 scores do not correlate with age; they are generally higher on the E <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Table  4b</span>), but  there is no  distinct regional pattern in  scores (not shown). A down-pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le decrease occurs  in scores of all soils except ES11 (1828 AD), re<span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ecting the distribution of organic matter. The reduc- tion in rate of decrease, or reversal of trend, at depth in the pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le found in pc3 scores occurs also in scores on pc4, with the  exception of ES10 (15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka); ES11 (1923 AD); ES12 (1651 AD); ES15 (1689 AD) and  ES17 (42<span class="s14">–</span>28 ka).

The spatial distribution of sample members in the  <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ve clusters (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Fig. 13</span>) comprises a form of soil map  for the sites sampled.

In this cluster, the range in age and cli- mate of sites, and the positive median score for all four pcs, give an im- pression of a complex of controls on pedogenesis leading to relatively similar outcome for all member samples.<br/>Cluster  2 (19 samples) is distinguished by the  highest pc3 scores (the <span class="s14">‘</span>high Fe<span class="s16">o-p</span>/Fe<span class="s16">d-o</span><span class="s14">–</span>high Mg<span class="s14">’ </span>pc) of all clusters. Sample scores on the remaining pcs are largely  negative. With  the  exception of ES5 (950 ±<br/>50 AD), this cluster does  not  occur  on the  west <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Fig. 13</span>), cluster<br/>members occurring at sites   with the   highest  rainfall (i.e. 750  to<br/>1250  mm).<br/>In Cluster 3 (20 samples), scores on pc1 and pc2 are largely negative. The cluster is distinguished by the highest median on pc4 (the <span class="s14">‘</span>high or- ganic matter<span class="s14">–</span>high C/N<span class="s14">–</span>high base pc<span class="s14">’</span>).

The cluster has the lowest distribution of scores on pc3, (the <span class="s14">‘</span>ferrihydrite<span class="s14">’ </span>pc). The weakly devel- oped samples, which occur  in ES11(1923 AD), ES22(1843 AD) and ES9(1809 AD), comprise the  coarsest tephra (highest .02<span class="s14">–</span>1.0 mm  %; lowest <span class="s14">b</span>.002 mm  %) and  the  highest Na amount (mean: 5.2 mg kg<span class="s21">− </span><span class="s16">1</span>) of all clusters.<br/>Cluster  5 (19  samples) is distinguished by its high  positive median on pc1 and its largely negative scores on other pcs.

Soil processes and pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>les<br/>The chief processes inferred from  our  data are  largely  those in- ferred in a number of previous studies of Mt Etna, particularly that of  <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Egli  et  al. (2008)</span>.  However, although loss  of Na is one  of the most marked features of our sequence of soils, we do not, in contrast to <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Egli et al. (2008) </span>and <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Busà et al. (1998)</span>, have evidence of loss of Ca or K. In our  sample, the  latter are associated with surface, organic- rich  horizons  and  retained in the soil, a feature re<span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ected in pc4, which subsumes high amounts of organic matter and high C/N ratios together with positive loadings for all bases.  Other chief processes we infer are: production of clay- and silt-size material; incorporation of organic matter and  its modi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cation in terms of decreasing C/N ratio; the formation of SROMS (indicated by NH<span class="s16">4</span>-extraction); devel- opment of soil structure, and a tendency for vigorous bioturbation in <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ner grained, older  soils. We do not  identify allophane directly, but  the  pca clearly  distinguishes conditions favouring allophane forma- tion.

An up-pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le increase in pc1 scores in many soils indicates greater near-surface intensity in certain major processes.<br/>Soils of limited development, generally with distinct organic-rich A horizon in some cases  overlain by an O horizon, but lacking  B horizon, occur on <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows dating up to 42<span class="s14">–</span>28 ka. These organic-rich horizons and</p><p class="s11">P.

With  increasing age of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow,  a <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ner texture occurs  and  bioturba- tion  is more in evidence. Only two soils have  Bw horizons, one  (ES6<br/>15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka) formed in <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>uvially deposited volcanic material, the  other<br/>(ES13 450 AD), a rich soil in a mature agricultural landscape. We do not  verify  the presence of illuviated clay using  micromorphological techniques,  but  we  <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>nd   no  suggestion of illuviation having taken place.  Nor are we able to quantify secondary crystalline clay minerals in the soils.<br/>In one agricultural terrace there is a buried soil (ES8 15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka), and<br/>two  pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>les (ES6 15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka and  ES17 15<span class="s14">–</span>3.9 ka) contain inwashed sediment, but there is no clear evidence of major disruption of pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le development in other soils, despite the  identi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cation of buried tephra units in two  of the  pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>les. With  the  exception of Mg (Supplementary Fig. 4), which we are not  able to explain, many properties measured do not  have  very irregular depth functions which would be expected in soils comprising tephra layers  of differing age. The near-surface en- hancement of organic matter, which occurs in all but one soil, is typical of pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>les which have  developed on relatively stable surfaces.<br/>8.2. Environmental factors<br/>Although the soils do not form a true chronosequence, their relation- ship with age will be formed in part by the oldest material in each  soil, regardless of addition of fresh  tephra. At least as important as <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow-age in determining soil character and distribution on the volcano are rainfall and  other, unmeasured, environmental contrasts between windward and lee sides of the volcano. The size of Mt Etna and direction of prevail- ing wind have  major implications for the  volcano&#39;s soil geography. Mt Etna is unique in its combination of volcanic activity and local climates. On the E and SE <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>anks, rainfall amounts should favour  pedogenesis, yet this appears to be restrained (as re<span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ected in low pc1 scores), possibly by tephra deposition. A complex interplay between effects  of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow-age, tephra deposition and  location on the  volcano is re<span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ected in the  map of cluster membership of samples (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Fig. 13</span>).<br/><span style=" color: #2E3092;">Lulli (2007) </span>concludes that the Mediterranean climate of volcanic re- gions  of Italy does  not  favour  allophane genesis and  the  full develop- ment of Andosols, but conditions favourable to allophane formation on Mt Etna are indicated in our analyses, and  Andisols  are classi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ed in a number of studies referred to in <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Section 3</span>.

(1988)</span>, and a reddened B ho- rizon  was reported in a Typic Hapludand in late Pleistocene pyroclastic material at 838 m a.s.l. on Vico Volcano, Italy (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Quantin et al., 1985</span>), but in the  soils we  examine, even  on the  drier,  more <span class="s14">‘</span>Mediterranean<span class="s14">’ </span>W <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ank,  and  on the 42<span class="s14">–</span>28 ka <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow,  neither reddening nor  evidence of clay  illuviation was  found.  This contrasts with Pleistocene volcanic soils elsewhere in the Mediterranean region: reddened soils with pedo- genic  calcite  and  illuviated clay in Pleistocene andesites of Methana, Greece, (m.a.r. <span class="s14">b </span>400 mm; <span style=" color: #2E3092;">James et al., 1997</span>) and on Quaternary basalts of Morocco (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Hamidi et al., 1999; Dekayir  and  El Maâtaoui, 2000</span>); and reddened soils in Pleistocene scoria  of the  Golan Heights, Israel (m.a.r.<br/>850<span class="s14">–</span>950 mm: <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Singer  et al., 2004</span>).<br/>8.3. Conclusion</p><p class="s11"><span class="s17">Fig. 11. </span>Dendrogram from cluster analysis using sample scores on  four principal compo- nents.

Our sample of soils is spread across a range of ecological, climatic and  agricultural environments. Ages of prehistoric lava <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows are only broadly constrained. For all <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows, known or estimated age gives only the  date  of onset of lava-weathering and  related pedogenesis. At un- known  intervals,  tephra has  contributed soil  parent material, this  forming the bulk of soils we examine. Two of the soils contain material inferred to  be  washed from  surrounding <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows. The sample of soils therefore comprises only an approximate chronosequence. Soil variabil- ity within single  <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ows is not examined explicitly, though, for example,</p><p class="s11">294                                                                                                        P.

We  infer  certain mineralogical properties from  chemical analyses, themselves arguably approxi- mate. The classi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cation of soils is only partial, and,  owing to the  ex- actitude  of  modern  soil  classi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cation  schemes,  would  require determination of further soil properties to complete. Whatever the  <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ner classes to which Mt Etna&#39;s  soils  may  be allocated, however, the majority of those we sample are entirely, and  inevitably, <span class="s14">‘</span>volca-  nic<span class="s14">’ </span>in their appearance and  major properties.<br/>The heuristic approach we take is chie<span class="s14">ﬂ</span>y statistical, with subjective<br/>interpretation of spatial patterns of selected properties. Our sample of soils is small, in view of Mt Etna&#39;s  diverse environments. Nevertheless, the number of signi<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>cant correlations, corroborated in many cases  by geographical distribution, appears to indicate a causal  relationship be-  tween a number of soil properties and,  respectively, age of lava <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow  and  rainfall (and presumably other important environmental contrasts between the volcano&#39;s <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>anks). This <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>nding echoes the  conclusion of <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Colombo  et al. (2007) </span>with respect to volcanic soils of south-central Italy, that such factors as duration of pedogenesis, human impact and  soil climate appear to play more important roles than effects of strati<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ed pyroclastic materials. Not investigated in the present study is the impact of vegetation on pedogenesis. The importance of plant cover  is evident<br/>from  previous research into  the  soils  of Mt  Etna  (<span style=" color: #2E3092;">Section 3</span>) and  is re<span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ected in the general relationship between vegetation and age of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow (Supplementary Table 1). Patterns we are not able  to explain include the increase of pH with age of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow and the higher Si<span class="s16">o-p </span>and Al<span class="s16">o-p </span>concen- trations on the  N slope.<br/>That age of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow  emerges as a chief soil-forming factor in the com-  plexity of the Etnean environment may  be  remarkable. Puzzling, however, is the correlation between age  of <span class="s14">ﬂ</span>ow  and  a number of soil properties for near-surface samples only. This <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>ts  easily  with neither <span class="s14">‘</span>retardant<span class="s14">’ </span>nor   <span class="s14">‘</span>developmental<span class="s14">’ </span>effects   (sensu <span style=" color: #2E3092;">Johnson,</span><br/><span style=" color: #2E3092;">1985</span>) of intermittent tephra deposition on soil pro<span class="s14">ﬁ</span>le development.<br/>The complexity of the effects  of tephra addition remains a challenge for research into the soils of Mt Etna. So too do processes at the  base  of soils and  the contribution of lava-bedrock weathering to soil pro-  <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>les.  The soil-rock interface remains a largely  unexplored soil envi-  ronment on the volcano.</p><p class="s15"><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2015.09.023" class="s24">Supplementary data  to this  article can be found online at </a>http://dx. doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2015.09.023<span style=" color: #231F20;">.</span></p><p class="s14">Acknowledgements</p><p>The authors are  grateful to the  Royal Geographical Society  (HSBC Small Grant) for covering part of <span class="s14">ﬁ</span>eldwork costs; to the  Universities of</p><p class="s11">P.
